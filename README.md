# Meal-Prep
This application is one I made to help me with my meal prepping macro tracking. 
In this app, the user chooses the amount of foods they want to enter and then enteres the name of the food and the weight in grams. 
The use then enters how many days and how many meals each day this food will be split up over. 
Then a database will be parsed with an API with a key that cam be fetched from https://api.data.gov/signup/
The API that I used is called noms and the doccumentation can be found here https://pypi.org/project/noms/
